## Introduction
Gone are the days of intuition-based decision making and every single organization is fast adopting the method of data driven decision making and reaping huge benefits. Before fully diverging into this technology, it is quite important for organizations to understand the bottlenecks and how to overcome them.

## Collecting Data

Gone are the days of intuition-based decision making and every single organization is fast adopting the method of data driven decision making and reaping huge benefits.

## Tool Selection

  Gone are the days of intuition-based decision making and every single organization is fast adopting the method of data driven decision making and reaping huge benefits. Before fully diverging into this technology, it is quite important for organizations to understand the bottlenecks and how to overcome them.

## Gatherdata

Data is available in various formats, we have structured (spreadsheets, SQL databases, online forms, POS systems, Web and Server logs etc.) and unstructured data (audio/video files, images, text files, email clients etc.). More often that not, we gather the data from websites using scrapping tools or the data is queried from database. The data format for all the reports will be not in unison. Bringing all the information together and analyzing them is quite tedious especially if it is done manually. It also increases the chances error, and the data becomes unreliable.


## randomcode

```python

filtered_payouts.rename(columns={'terminal_id (DISTINCT_COUNT)_x':'Active', 'terminal_id (DISTINCT_COUNT)_y':'Total Terminals', 'deposit (SUM)':'Deposits', 'Disbursment (SUM)':'Disbursements', 'pay_amt (SUM)':'Payouts'},errors='raise',inplace='True')
```

## Table

|Sr.No|Topic|Description|
